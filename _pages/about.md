 I'm currently a ~~first~~ ~~second~~ third-year PhD student at [Ruhr-University Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en), having moved here in November 2023 with my supervisor [Prof. Dr. Setareh Maghsudi](https://etit.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en/lts/team/prof-dr-ing-setareh-maghsudi/) from Tuebingen. I earned my Master's degree in Theory and Method of Artificial Intelligence from [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/).


**I am currently on the industry job market. Please feel free to contact me if you have available positions.**

<summary>Research Interests: Reinforcement Learning & RLHF, Human-AI Alignment, Large Language Models, Game AI</summary>
<br>

I'm broadly interested in large language models, human-AI alignment, reinforcement learning & RLHF, and AI security. Currently, my research aims to i) understand the structural information of deep RL & LLMs and how to leverage it to improve agent performance in the wild (e.g., dealing with biased, noisy, or redundant data, or extrapolating to unseen tasks/environments), ii) develop controllable AI in both training and inference/adaptation; and iii) theory and real-world application of Human-AI alignment. And Yes we are developing these methods for RL and LLMs.


<br><br> The working title of my PhD thesis is "Towards Human-friendly Reinforcement Learning: Structural Analysis, Control Mechanisms, and Human-AI Alignment".



<br><br>Our research is built upon the empirical and theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics, utilizing tools from stochastic processes, functional analysis, algebra, optimization, information theory, and large language models. Our goal is to develop efficient, stable, trustworthy agents based on coevolution between humans and agents.
