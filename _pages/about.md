I'm broadly interested in large language models, human-AI alignment, RLHF, and AI security. Currently, my research aims to i) develop controllable AI in both training and inference/adaptation; ii) theory and real-world application of Human-AI alignment; and iii) understand the structural information of LLMs, RLHF & RL and how to leverage it to enable agent performance. And yes, we are developing these methods for RL and LLMs. Our [technology](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=eN1T7I7OpZ) powers the world's most popular fighting game.
